# CS-587-Capstone-Project
Repository for CS 587 Cyber Security Capstone experience

Only thing I got is three docker containers. You can startup with this command:

```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

You can access the shell for a container with this command:

```
sudo docker exec -it <container-name> bash
```
